Tindy.md, trust me it ryhmes, was built to make it more convenient to take notes with markdown from the terminal, quickly and easily. This is not all it can it do tho, Tindy also includes the capability that comes with a generic text editor like vim, which of course you could use if you want to download 100 plugins to make it capable of taking notes, or if you're like me, you can download Tindy, which works with markdown out of the box and requires minimal setup.
